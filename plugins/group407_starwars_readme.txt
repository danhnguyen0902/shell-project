USING THIS PLUGIN

Simply add the group407_starwars.so plugin to your plugin folder of choice.  Running
esh with the commands '-p [plugin directory]' will add all plugins, including this 
one, to your shell.

WHAT IT IS

This is a simple plugin that allows you to do three things:
1) Watch Star Wars: A New Hope in ASCII
2) Figure out who plays who in the film
3) Take a short quiz to see how Jedi you are.
----------------------------
USE

"starwars"       - will give you the list of commands
"starwars -info" - will tell you who plays what part
"starwars -quiz" - will quiz you on your trivia knowledge
"starwars -play" - will prompt you to watch the ASCII film (WARNING: You can't quit out of this while it's running, hence the prompt!)
